        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Effective Date: January 29, 2026</p>

        <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the products and services provided by Fada Labs ("we," "us," or "our"), including <strong>GoChatter</strong> (AI-powered English tutor) and <strong>Theo</strong> (AI companion with long-term memory). By accessing or using our services, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

        <h2>1. User Eligibility</h2>
        <p>You must be at least <strong>16 years of age</strong> to use our services. If you are between 16 and 18 years old, you represent that you have your parent's or legal guardian's consent to use our services. We do not knowingly provide services to children under 13. If we learn that a user is under 13, we will terminate their account and delete their data.</p>

        <h2>2. Account Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials. You agree to provide accurate information during registration and to notify us promptly of any unauthorized use of your account. You are liable for all activity that occurs under your account.</p>

        <h2>3. AI Disclaimer</h2>
        <p><strong>GoChatter and Theo are powered by artificial intelligence. By using our services, you acknowledge and agree to the following:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>AI-generated content may contain errors, inaccuracies, or outdated information. You should not rely on AI responses as a substitute for professional advice, including but not limited to medical, legal, financial, or educational guidance.</li>
            <li>GoChatter is a language practice tool, not a certified educational institution. It does not grant certifications, diplomas, or formal qualifications. Language corrections and suggestions are AI-generated and may not always be accurate.</li>
            <li>Theo is an AI companion and does not provide mental health counseling, therapy, or medical advice. Theo's responses are generated by a machine learning model and should not be treated as human conversation or professional support.</li>
            <li>We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, reliability, or suitability of any AI-generated content for any purpose.</li>
            <li>AI models are provided by third-party services (OpenAI), and their availability, behavior, or capabilities may change without prior notice from us.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
        <p>Our services are offered on a subscription basis. All payments are processed by <strong>Lemon Squeezy</strong>, which acts as our Merchant of Record. By subscribing, you agree to the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Billing:</strong> Lemon Squeezy handles all billing, invoicing, and payment processing. Your financial data is managed by Lemon Squeezy in accordance with their <a href="https://www.lemonsqueezy.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">privacy policy</a> and <a href="https://www.lemonsqueezy.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">terms of service</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Recurring Charges:</strong> Subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle (monthly or annual) unless canceled before the renewal date.</li>
            <li><strong>Cancellation:</strong> You may cancel your subscription at any time through your account settings or by contacting us. Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period. No partial refunds are provided for unused time within a billing cycle.</li>
            <li><strong>Refunds:</strong> Refund requests are handled by Lemon Squeezy in accordance with their refund policies and applicable consumer protection laws.</li>
            <li><strong>Price Changes:</strong> We reserve the right to change subscription pricing. You will be notified at least 30 days before any price increase takes effect. Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the new pricing.</li>
            <li><strong>Taxes:</strong> Lemon Squeezy, as Merchant of Record, is responsible for calculating and collecting applicable sales tax, VAT, or other taxes as required by law.</li>
        </ul>
