        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Effective Date: January 29, 2026</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Fada Labs ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our products: <strong>GoChatter</strong> (AI-powered English tutor) and <strong>Theo</strong> (AI companion with long-term memory). By using our services, you agree to the practices described below.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>1.1 Information You Provide</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> Email address and display name when you create an account.</li>
            <li><strong>Chat History:</strong> Messages and conversations you have with GoChatter and Theo, including text inputs and AI-generated responses.</li>
            <li><strong>Theo Conversation Memory:</strong> Theo stores summaries and contextual details from your conversations to maintain continuity across sessions. This memory is tied to your account and is used solely to personalize your experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment Information:</strong> Payment details are collected and processed by our Merchant of Record, Lemon Squeezy. We do not store your credit card or payment information on our servers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.2 Information Collected Automatically</h3>

            <li>Device type, operating system, and browser information.</li>
            <li>IP address and approximate geolocation (country/region level).</li>
            <li>Usage data such as session duration, features used, and interaction patterns.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide, maintain, and improve GoChatter and Theo.</li>
            <li>To personalize your experience, including Theo's long-term memory features.</li>
            <li>To process subscriptions and payments through Lemon Squeezy.</li>
            <li>To communicate important updates, service notices, or promotional information.</li>
            <li>To comply with legal obligations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Third-Party AI Processing (OpenAI)</h2>
        <p>Both GoChatter and Theo use the <strong>OpenAI API</strong> to process conversations and generate AI responses. When you interact with our apps, your messages are sent to OpenAI's servers for processing. OpenAI processes this data in accordance with their <a href="https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">API data usage policies</a>, which state that API inputs and outputs are not used to train their models.</p>
        <p>We send only the minimum data necessary for AI processing. We do not share your email address or payment information with OpenAI.</p>

        <h2>4. Theo's Conversation Memory</h2>
        <p>Theo is designed to remember context from your past conversations to create a more personal experience. This memory includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Key topics and preferences you've shared.</li>
            <li>Contextual summaries of prior conversations.</li>
            <li>Personal details you choose to share during conversations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can request deletion of Theo's memory at any time by contacting us at <a href="mailto:admin@fadalabs.com">admin@fadalabs.com</a>. Deleting your account will permanently erase all stored memory data.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal data. We share information only with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>OpenAI:</strong> For AI processing as described above.</li>
            <li><strong>Lemon Squeezy:</strong> For payment processing and subscription management.</li>
            <li><strong>Law enforcement:</strong> When required by law, subpoena, or legal process.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain your data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide our services. Chat history and Theo's memory are retained until you request deletion or delete your account. After account deletion, we remove your personal data within 30 days, except where retention is required by law.</p>
